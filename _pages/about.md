Hello 👋

I’m Yash Sharma, a backend and Web3 engineer focused on building high-throughput DeFi analytics and real-time gaming platforms. I enjoy owning products end-to-end—from designing data models and distributed workers to tuning latency budgets and production reliability.

Most recently I:

- Built FastAPI microservices, Redis-backed workers, and PostgreSQL schemas for provably-fair betting games (Dice, Plinko, etc), scaling to real-time workloads.
- Developed DexCheck.io’s multi-chain listeners (Ethereum, BSC, Base) using Web3.py, Kafka, and Prometheus — reduced processing latency by 50% while maintaining 120ms P95 APIs.
- Designed transaction-safe execution workflows, partitioned analytics stores, and telemetry dashboards that improved developer confidence in data-driven decisions.

<p>Day to day you'll find me deep in Python, Web3 infrastructure, and observability dashboards—always looking for cleaner abstractions and better developer ergonomics. I'm open to backend or Web3 roles where reliability and low latency matter.
